# Config systems

It should be possible to configure the server either via command-line arguments or via a TypeScript config file that is simply imported. The TypeScript config file should just, like we should be able to seasdasdasd
t, basically, the server port (it defaults to zero, which is just like any old ephemeral port and then it prints out which port it goes on). Then the folder, the root folder 1 in which the tasks are relative to the location of the config. Then it should be possible via command-line argument also to point the binary at a different config file path relative to the current working directory from where the binaries run. And then… what else do we want? That's pretty much it.
